# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description
A Python-based web application that is similar to AirBnB. The project's primary goal 
is to develop a command-line interpreter that will allow users to control AirBnB 
objects using a command-line interface. The command interpreter will allow you to 
create, retrieve, update, and destroy objects, as well as conduct actions on them.


## Console
The console, often known as the command interpreter, is a tool that lets users to
interact with the AirBnB clone project via the command line. It provides a set of 
commands for doing various activities such as object management, information querying,
and operation execution.

## How to Begin
To launch the command interpreter, perform the following steps:
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yhaw-Emma/AirBnB_clone.git`
2. Go to the project directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
3. Start the console: `./console.py`

## How to Apply
You can use the following commands once the console is up and running:

- `all`: List all objects of a particular type.
- `create`: Make a new object such as User and Place.
- `count`: Determine the number of items.
- `compute`: Carry out numerous calculations and statistics.
- `destroy`: Remove an object.
- `show`: Display details about a certain object.
- `update`: An object attributes should be updated.
