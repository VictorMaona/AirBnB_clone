##0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
Static content on a website is often referred to as web static. A website's static 
content is the portion that is constant across all users and doesn't change dynamically. 
This can include resources that are provided to the user's web browser unchanged, such 
as photos, stylesheets files, HTML files, and others.

In contrast to dynamic content, which is created on the server in real-time and might 
change depending on user input or other circumstances, static content is predetermined
 in advance. Database-driven web pages, user-generated content, and interactive online 
applications are examples of dynamic content.
